S2 HOU should be 1 game worse		2.2 (13) has HOU and TEX switched
S2 SFG should be 1 game better		2.12 (122) has SFG and TB switched
S2 SDP should be 1 game better		Roster sheet is just wrong. SDP should be 6-12
S3 OAK should be 1 game worse		2.15 (173) 269 on OAK got the final out of T2. KCR's 131 did not pitch long enough as the starter to be eligible for the W, so 269 got the W for KCR, and also the L for OAK. Function does not allow a player to get both the W and L, so L was left empty
S3 ARI has one too many decisions	3.12 (137) 321 on SDP got the first out of T4

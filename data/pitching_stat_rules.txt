### Pitching Stat Rules for MLR (6-Inning Games)

Here is a detailed breakdown of how wins, losses, saves, and holds are awarded in MLR, based on a 6-inning game structure.

---

#### **Win (W)**

A single pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win.

*   **Case 1: Starting Pitcher Earns the Win**
    *   The starting pitcher must pitch at least **3 and 1/3 innings**.
    *   Their team must have the lead when the pitcher leaves the game.
    *   That lead must never be given up for the rest of the game.
    *   *Example:* The starter pitches 4 innings, leaving with a 5-2 lead. The team wins 5-3. The starter gets the win.

*   **Case 2: Relief Pitcher Earns the Win (Starter Doesn't Qualify)**
    *   The starting pitcher pitches **less than 3 and 1/3 innings**.
    *   The team has the lead when the starter leaves, and they never give it up.
    *   The win is awarded to the **first relief pitcher to record at least one out**.
    *   *Example:* The starter pitches 3 innings, leaving with a 4-1 lead. The team wins 4-2. The win is awarded to a reliever, not the starter.

*   **Case 3: Relief Pitcher Earns the Win (Lead Change)**
    *   The game is tied or the pitcher's team is behind when they are in the game.
    *   While that pitcher is still the pitcher of record, their team takes the lead.
    *   The team never gives up that lead.
    *   *Example:* A relief pitcher enters in the 5th inning with the score tied 2-2. Their team scores in the bottom of the 5th to make it 3-2. The game ends 3-2. That relief pitcher gets the win.

#### **Loss (L)**

A single pitcher on the losing team is awarded a loss.

*   **Case 1: Pitcher Allows the Go-Ahead Run**
    *   A pitcher allows one or more runs to score, which gives the opposing team a lead.
    *   The opposing team never gives up that lead for the rest of the game.
    *   This pitcher is charged with the loss.
    *   *Example:* A pitcher is pitching in the 4th inning with a 2-1 lead. They allow two runs, making the score 2-3. The game ends 2-3. This pitcher gets the loss.

*   **Case 2: Pitcher Leaves Runners on Base**
    *   A pitcher leaves the game with one or more runners on base.
    *   Those runners later score, and one of them is the run that gives the opposing team a lead they never give up.
    *   The pitcher who allowed those runners to get on base is charged with the loss.
    *   *Example:* A pitcher leaves the game in the 5th inning with the bases loaded and a 4-2 lead. The next pitcher allows all three runners to score, making it 4-5. The game ends 4-5. The pitcher who left the bases loaded gets the loss.

#### **Save (SV)**

A single relief pitcher on the winning team can be awarded a save. The pitcher who gets the save cannot also get the win.

*   **Case 1: The "Standard" Save**
    *   The pitcher is the *final* pitcher for the winning team.
    *   They enter the game with a lead of **3 runs or less**.
    *   They pitch for at least **1 full inning**.
    *   *Example:* A pitcher enters in the 6th inning with a 5-3 lead and finishes the game. They get a save.

*   **Case 2: The "Tying Run" Save**
    *   The pitcher is the *final* pitcher for the winning team.
    *   They enter the game with the potential tying run already on base, at bat, or on the on-deck circle.
    *   *Example:* A pitcher enters in the 6th inning with a 2-0 lead, but the bases are loaded. The tying run is on second base. The pitcher gets the final out. They get a save.

*   **Case 3: The "Long Relief" Save**
    *   The pitcher is the *final* pitcher for the winning team.
    *   They pitch for at least **3 innings** to finish the game.
    *   *Example:* A pitcher enters in the 4th inning with a 10-2 lead and pitches the rest of the game. They get a save.

#### **Hold (HLD)**

One or more relief pitchers can be awarded a hold in a game. A pitcher cannot get a win or a save in the same game as a hold.

*   **Case 1: The "Bridge"**
    *   A relief pitcher enters the game in a "save situation" (see the save rules above).
    *   They record at least one out.
    *   They leave the game with their team still in the lead.
    *   *Example:* The starter leaves after 4 innings with a 5-3 lead. A reliever comes in, pitches the 5th inning, and leaves with the score still 5-3. Another pitcher comes in to finish the 6th. The reliever who pitched the 5th inning gets a hold.

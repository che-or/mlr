Runs scored by inherited runners are not counted against a pitcher's `nERA`.</li><li><strong>Responsibility for Runners Left on Base:</strong> When a pitcher exits mid-inning, they are still responsible for the runners they leave behind. To account for this, the simulation uses the <strong>Run Expectancy (RE) Matrix</strong> to calculate the probable number of runs that will score. It intelligently separates the run expectancy of inherited runners from the pitcher's own runners, ensuring the pitcher is only charged for the run potential they created.</li></ol><p>This comprehensive simulation produces a pitcher's `nERA`, which reflects their performance independent of park effects. This `nERA` is then compared against the league-average `nERA` to produce the final ERA+.</p><p><strong>Career ERA+</strong> is calculated using the same logic, but with the player's career park-neutral ERA (`nERA`) measured against a career league-average `nERA` (weighted by the player's innings pitched in each season). This provides a more accurate career value than averaging seasonal ERA+ values.</p>"

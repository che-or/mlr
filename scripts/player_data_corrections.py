    Applies manual post-processing corrections to aggregated player statistics.

    This is intended for cases where data errors (like a pitcher appearing for two teams
    in the same game) are not caught during initial gamelog processing and need to be
    fixed in the final aggregated data.

    Args:
        player_stats_df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing aggregated player stats
                                        (e.g., all_pitching_stats from generate_web_data.py).

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The corrected DataFrame.
    
    Note:
        Applying corrections at this stage can be complex. For example, if you
        merge stats for a player who appeared under two teams, you will likely need
        to recalculate all rate stats (ERA, WHIP, BAA, etc.) for the new combined row.
        Correcting the raw gamelog data *before* aggregation is often a simpler approach.
